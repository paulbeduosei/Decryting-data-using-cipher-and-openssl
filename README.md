# Decryting-data-using-cipher-and-openssl
The task was to recover encrypted data by working through a series of steps that involved exploring directories, reading files, decoding a classical cipher, and finally decrypting the target file using OpenSSL. This exercise combined file system navigation, cryptography, and Linux command-line tools to restore the file to its original state.
