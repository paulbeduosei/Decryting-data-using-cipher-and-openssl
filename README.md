# Decryting-data-using-cipher-and-openssl
The task was to recover encrypted data by working through a series of steps that involved exploring directories, reading files, decoding a classical cipher, and finally decrypting the target file using OpenSSL. This exercise combined file system navigation, cryptography, and Linux command-line tools to restore the file to its original state. In this project, I practiced listing directories, reading file contents, applying Linux commands to decode a Caesar cipher, and using OpenSSL to decrypt a file. These steps demonstrated how classical cryptography and modern encryption tools can be combined to securely protect and successfully recover data.
